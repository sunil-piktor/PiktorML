##supervised learning--feeding the data to the model to predict the desirable output.
example-1==Given a set of datas like traffic intensity,time and weather condition, model learns to predict estimated time to reach home from office.
example==2 Training the students on particular set of subject to get good marks.Eventually the model(student) learns to get good marks in exam based on given input data(teaching)

##Unsupervised learning-
example-1==normal human behaviour,Who's system functionality has been pre-defined and he has learnt the things do himself.For exaple he can react to fear,happines,sadness on his own without any additional data being provided.

##classification
This the supervised learning method where we will provide set of labels to the properties and based on that classification happens.For example students grade classification based on his marks,Bank details classification based on customers type of job and salary.

##clustering 
This clustering follows the unsupervised learning, where grouping happens based on the properties of the datas
for example grouping mammals and reptiles,grouping birds and fishes etc
